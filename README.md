Film Studio Process Automation with Telegram Bots and Dashboards
This repository contains the source code and documentation for automating and optimizing the workflows of a film studio. The project aims to streamline scene layout design, equipment placement, and studio management processes through the integration of Telegram bots and a real-time dashboard. The goal is to reduce the manual workload and improve efficiency in production, pre-production, and post-production stages.

Project Overview
In a typical film studio, managing the layout and placement of objects, equipment, and set pieces requires significant manual effort and coordination. This project introduces a solution to automate key processes, such as:

Scene layout design and approval.
Furniture and equipment placement for scenes.
Real-time notifications and task tracking for various studio roles.
Version control for scene designs and layout revisions.
Key Features:
Scene Layout Design Requests: Managers can submit requests for scene designs through a Telegram bot, which are automatically logged for designers.
Real-Time Notifications: All stakeholders (managers, designers, workers) receive real-time updates on the status of tasks.
Version Control: Every design iteration is stored with version control, allowing easy tracking of changes.
Dashboard Integration: A centralized dashboard displays all ongoing tasks, statuses, and design versions.
Automated Workflows: Once a design is approved, workers receive the final layout directly via the bot and can begin scene setup.
Commenting and Feedback: Managers and administrators can provide feedback on designs directly through the bot.
